# Discord Liar Dice Bot

To create the bot for yourself, clone or download the files. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application named Liar's Dice. Once created, in the bot tab for the application set 'Server Members Intent' to on. Copy the Client Secret to a text file. Once finished, create a file named config.py in the folder with the LiarsDice.py file. Inside this Python file set a variable, DISCORD_API_KEY equal to your Client Secret. To add the bot to a server go back to the developer portal, then click the application and go to the OAuth2 tab. In the URL generator set the scope to 'bot' and the permission 'Send Messages' to on. Then copy the link and paste and go into your browser. Now just select a server, run the python script, and play!
